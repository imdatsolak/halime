Changes 1.0b
- Small changes in the Norwegian localization
- When viewing a posting and "Autocheck for new" was switched on, Halime would lose the focus when the currently active group was updated - fixed
- Added "Catch Up Subscription"
- Fixed threaded display bugs: Now "Load parent posting..." works correctly (this may slow down checking for new postings)
- Check for new postings on loading of a subscription: If "Auto check for new" is switched on, Halime now automatically checks for new postings on load of a subscription
- Added "Load posting with Message-ID"; This allows to enter a message ID for Halime to load that message
- Added "Lock/Unlock Selected Postings": Locked postings are not deleted/removed when using "Remove"; If you want to delete them, you need to unlock first. Beware: Locking is done RECURSIVELY, that is if you lock the parent posting of a thread, all sub postings are locked, too (but you can unlock them, of course)
- Cross-group "Mark Read/Unread": When a cross-posted posting is read/unread in one group, it is automatically marked read/unread in other groups of the same subscription now
- Cross-group "Load posting": When a cross-posted postings body is loaded in one group, it is automatically loaded in other groups in the same subscription, too.
- "Detailed Tooltips" in the GTV now ignores quoted text in follow-ups
- Fixed some bugs in German localization
- Fixed a bug which prevented canceling of messages
- Added a new non-Command-shortcut, "." (period): This marks the current group as read and removes all postings in it and moves to the next group in subscription (Mark Group Read + Catch Up + Next Group). Attention: This action is done WITHOUT any alert boxes, use it only, if you know what you are doing ;-)
- Fixed a bug which prevented from following-up certain postings
- Removed Dutch localization on popular demand
- Fixed certain other bugs and improved performance a bit
- Note: This is the first beta version of Halime; Please send all _bug-reports_ to halime@imdat.de
- Note2: The localization files (except for German and English) contain non-local terms which will be translated in the next beta-release(s)

// - Added threaded subscription saving, i.e.: When you choose "Save Subscription", you can immediately keep working, the saving will happen in the background
